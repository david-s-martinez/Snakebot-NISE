## Tasks
1. In the example “RS_neuron.ino” add two additional neurons to the network. And demonstrate
four different patterns (OSCILLATORY, QUIESCENT, PLATEAU, and ALMOSTOSC), each neuron
with a single pattern. [10% of the grade]

2. By trial and error, find the oscillatory pattern that approximately doubles the frequency of the
oscillatory pattern presented in the example. Demonstrate your results on two neurons using
two different patterns. The finger presented below gives you some hints to understand how
patterns are distributed in the space of “sigma_s” and “sigma_f” [10% of the grade]

3. Refer to the paper [Matsuoka 1985] to modulate the Mutually Inhibiting Neurons presented in
section 2 of the paper, please use the adaptation terms as well. Demonstrate Figure 1 on the
step response with the three different cases. [20% of the grade]. Demonstrate the coupling of
two mutually inhibiting neurons as in Figure 2 [20% of the grade].

4. Select different coupling on three and four neurons and demonstrate the output. [10% of the
grade].

5. Inspired by Figure 1 in the paper [Ijspeert et al. 2007], propose a coupling for ten motors snake
using 20 neurons. [10% of the grade], use Matsuoka oscilator.

6. Optimize your solution method of the differential equations so that you can obtain your
program of step 5 running faster, and report the cycle time [20% of the grade].
